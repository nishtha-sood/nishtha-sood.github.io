# Proj#2 - U.S. Gender Wage Gap Analysis

## Summary of Project

This project explores gender-based wage disparities across the United States using publicly available data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. The focus is on identifying wage gaps between men and women across different education levels, job types, and work arrangements (e.g., remote, full-time).

The project combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visual storytelling to uncover how gender, education, and work flexibility affect earnings and to quantify the gap with regression techniques.

**Part I â€“ Data Preparation**  
The dataset includes earnings by gender, education level, job type, and work flexibility (full-time/remote). Key steps included:
- Cleaning nulls and fixing formats
- Creating new indicators like `wage_gap_percent`
- Grouping by categories for comparative analysis

**Part II â€“ Analysis & Visualization (`gender_wage_gap_analysis.ipynb`)**  
Explored trends in wage gaps:
- Across education levels (e.g., Bachelorâ€™s vs. High School)
- Across job flexibility (remote vs. on-site)
- Wage gap percent across industries

Used regression to estimate the degree to which gender explains wage differences, controlling for education and work type. Presented interactive and static visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
