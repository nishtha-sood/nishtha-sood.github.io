Welcome to my portfolio! I’m currently pursuing my MBA in Marketing Analytics at Pace University in New York, and I love using data to help brands make smarter decisions.

My journey started in visual merchandising and customer care — but over time, I found myself drawn more to the patterns behind customer behavior than the front-facing side. That's when I dove deep into analytics: from crunching sanitation data to forecast food waste in NYC, to mapping wage gaps across industries, I’m always looking for insights that tell a real story.

Whether it's optimizing campaign performance or building dashboards that actually make sense to non-technical teams — I'm passionate about bridging the gap between **data and business impact**.

## 🎯 About Me & My Data Journey

I’m currently a Marketing Intern at the Pace SBDC where I support small businesses with analytics-backed strategies — managing CRM campaigns, analyzing web traffic, and automating workflows.

Before this, I worked across customer support, visual merchandising, and institutional outreach at brands like Forest Essentials and Tech Mahindra. These roles helped me understand business from the ground up.

Today, I bring those experiences into the world of data — combining **marketing instincts** with **technical skills** like R, SQL, and Tableau to help solve real problems.
